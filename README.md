-house price prediction

The prediction of house prices is a crucial task in the real estate industry, as
it provides valuable insights to buyers, sellers, and investors. Accurate
house price prediction can help potential buyers make informed decisions
about their investments, assist sellers in determining a fair asking price, and
enable investors to identify profitable opportunities. With the rapid
advancements in machine learning techniques, leveraging these algorithms
for house price prediction has gained significant attention.


Bangalore, a major city in India, is experiencing a dynamic real estate
market with a multitude of factors influencing house prices. The city's rapid
urbanization, economic growth, and increasing population have contributed
to the complexity of predicting house prices accurately. Traditional
methods for price estimation often fall short in capturing the intricate
relationships among various features that impact property values. Thus, the
utilization of machine learning algorithms presents a promising approach to
address this challenge



In this study, we aim to explore the effectiveness of various machine
learning algorithms for predicting house prices in Bangalore. We leverage a
diverse set of features that encompass the geographical location, property
size, number of rooms, amenities, and other relevant factors that influence
the housing market. By employing machine learning algorithms, we can
identify patterns and correlations within the data that are otherwise difficult
to discern using conventional methods.
